	<h3>What is W-Trouble?</h3>
	<p>
	W-Trouble is an FF7 challenge playthrough inspired by Final Fantasy 5's <a href="https://www.fourjobfiesta.com/">Four Job Fiesta</a> that aims to create a unique repeatable experience using randomized options for an FF7 playthrough. This challenge is designed to be beginner friendly and can be adapted as needed! The goal for this challenge is to beat the game within the boundaries set out by the randomization options.
	<br />
	<br />
	The randomization options will:</p>
	<ol class="faqlist">
		<li>Specify what optional characters you are required to use. Yuffie and Vincent (if required) must be recruited at their earliest available opportunity. If Aerith is rolled, a replacement character is indicated to be used after CD1. <br />
		In the case when a character forces himself into the party or becomes unavailable, the player can choose their replacement freely but characters aside Cloud and the W-Trouble characters cannot use any materia or limits.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Specify what equipment can be changed per character. By default, randomization options will roll the same equipment for each character. You can optionally select to roll for character's equipment independently by selecting the checkbox on the page and using the <i>Roll Eq</i> option associated to each character.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Specify two optional events that are recommended to be completed during your playthrough. Note: If Pagoda is rolled and Yuffie is not a required character, then Yuffie may act as Cloud for the purposes of that event.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Specify a specific limit tier that must be used by the party. You can use other limits only to earn the required limit tier. If a limit tier is rolled that is inaccessible for a particular character, then they simply do not get to use limits. <br /><span id="csdice">Sorry Cait Sith, no dice!</span></li>
		<br />
		<li>Specify two materia classes; only materia from those two classes can be used during the playthrough.</li>
